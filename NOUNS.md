## Serialization Format

All DO definitions serialize to JSON with:
- `$type`: Entity type name
- `$version`: Schema version
- Data fields as strings with type hints: `'Description (number)'`
- Generative fields with `{variables}`: `'Generate {name} for {context}'`
- Cascades with operators: `'->Type'` or `'Prompt ->Type'`
- Functions as stringified code: `"(x) => x * 2"`
- Events/schedules as stringified handlers

This JSON can be:
1. Stored in database as data
2. Parsed back into executable DO definitions
3. Functions executed via ai-evaluate sandbox
